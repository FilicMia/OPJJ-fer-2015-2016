Homeworks done as part of the subject "Osnove programskog jezika JAVA" held at FER, year 2015/2016.
Each subfolder represents one homework, it contains the solution as well as the assigment (as numer_of_homework.pdf file).
HW(number of homework)-1191227025 folder is one Eclipse project and as such can be imported in Eclipse after the download.
Be careful, not every subfolder is Eclipse project, HW(number of homework) named subfolders are NOT. In that case, they contains subsubfolder of name HW(number of homework)-1191227025 which is Eclipse project.
